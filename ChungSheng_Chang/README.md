## Limitations of Chatbots in Analyzing Real-World Stock Markets
### **1. Lack of Real-Time Decision-Making**
- **Reason**: Chatbots typically rely on pre-fetched or static data sources like APIs and do not perform real-time analysis at the speed required for high-frequency trading or dynamic decision-making.
- **Impact**: In fast-moving markets, even a slight delay in data retrieval and processing can lead to outdated insights or missed opportunities.
- **Solution**: Integration with real-time data streams and advanced predictive models would enhance the chatbot‚Äôs capability.

### **2. Limited Contextual Understanding of Macroeconomic Factors**
- **Reason**: Chatbots often lack the ability to interpret and correlate macroeconomic indicators, global news, and geopolitical events with their potential impacts on stock markets. For example:
  - Understanding how interest rate changes affect stock sectors.
  - Correlating global conflicts or pandemics with market movements.
- **Impact**: Without this contextual awareness, chatbot predictions or insights may be overly simplistic or inaccurate.
- **Solution**: Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze and summarize global news, combined with economic data processing, could improve the chatbot's contextual understanding.
